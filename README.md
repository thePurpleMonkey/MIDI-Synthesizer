# MIDI Synthesizer

## Dependencies
This project requires Python 3 to run. It has been tested with Python 3.5, 
but other minor versions may work as well. 

This project depends on the [mido](https://mido.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
Python package for reading and parsing MIDI files.

## Running
To run this project, use the following syntax:
```bash
python3 midi_player.py <input file> <output file> 
```

`<input file>` is the MIDI file to synthesize

`<output file>` is the wav file to save the result
